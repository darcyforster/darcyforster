I am a PhD candidate at the University of Sydney, Australia currently completing a thesis on the philosophy of Friedrich Schelling. My other areas of interest include process philosophy, psychedelic science and philosophy of technology.

Education:
======
* Bachelor of Arts (Honours), Swinburne University, Melbourne 2019
  I graduated with first class honours majoring in philosophy with a minor in cinema studies. My thesis attempted to outline an emergentist account of substance dualism by drawing on the works of Friedrich Schelling, Carl Jung, and Iain McGilchrist.

**Thesis Title:** "Mapping the Psyche-Civilisation Relationship"

**Supervisor:** A/Prof. Arran Gare
* Ph.D. University of Sydney, 2025 (expected)
  My disertation originally intended to provide a philosophical interpretation of the psychedelic experience and other related altered states of consciousness. However, I soon decided to focus my entire attention on Schelling in an attempt to draw out a consistent theory of experience from his expansive oeuvre. While my ultimate intention is to adapt Schelling's theory of experience to contemporary questions surrounding the nature of altered states of consciousness, this is not directly attempted in my dissertation.

**Thesis Title:** "Schelling's Philosophical Methodology"

**Supervisor:** A/Prof. Dalia Nassar
* Visiting Ph.D. candidate, University College Dublin, 2023
  I spent three months at University College Dublin on a research exchange funded by the Erasmus+ International Credit Mobility Scheme. 

  **Supervisor:** A/Prof. Joseph Cohen
