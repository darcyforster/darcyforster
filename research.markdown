Thesis
======
My thesis focusses on F. W. J. Schelling's (1775-1854) "philosophical methodology" as it is expressed through *intellectual intuition* and *metaphysical empiricism*. The significance I ascribe to these twin terms are twofold. On the one hand, they both point to a form of experiential knowing that attempts to transcend normal *empirical* cognition (i.e., the kind of cognition that depends on the conformity between some concept and a corresponding sensible intuition) and on the other hand, they represent a bridge between Schelling's early and late works.

The reduction of experience to empirical cognition occurred most forcefully in Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason*. There the 'bounds of possible experience' were determined in accordance with the pure concepts of the understanding (Kant's famous table of categories). Thus, an experience is only 'possible' if it can be conceptually determined. When it comes to understanding altered states of consciousness (like the psychedelic experience), however, Kant's model of empirical cognition becomes rather unhelpful.

The term "ineffable" is widely used by those who have the kinds of experiences that fall beyond the bounds of conceptual determination. Thus, the empirical model of cognition has no means of verifying the legitimacy (or even the actuality) of such experiences. Such a sentiment is expressed by the scientific community when altered states of consciousness like the psychedelic experience are referred to as "hallucinations."

Accounting for altered states of consciousness as "hallucinations" is not itself problematic. But recent research has shown that some of the most positive effects of psychedelic therapy, for instance, are contingent on the "ineffability" of the experience, that is their refusal to be conceptually determined. This is all to say that a non-empirical account of experience is desperately lacking in modern psychiatric science, which makes Schelling a rather salient thinker.

The second aim of my thesis is to draw a historiographical connection between Schelling's use of *intellectual intuition* and *metaphysical empiricism*. Schelling has long been regarded as a 'protean' thinker who failed to hold any consistent philosophical commitments, although scholars began challenging this around the middle of the 20th century. Thus, Schelling scholarship is in the process of determining significant connections between his early and late works.

Schelling adopted the term "intellectual intuition" in the mid-1790s and continued to develop its meaning and application well into the 19th century. However, there was a sudden break in his productivity after 1815 prompted by the death of his wife, Caroline. Afterwards Schelling began to rely more heavily on the spoken word to express his ideas, ceasing to publish any more writings. It is not until the Munich Lectures (1832-3) that Schelling introduces his method of "metaphysical empiricism."
